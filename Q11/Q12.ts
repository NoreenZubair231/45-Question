//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let fNames: string[] = ["Alishba", "Komal", "Madiha"];

console.log(`Hello, ${fNames[0]}!`);
console.log(`Hello, ${fNames[1]}!`);
console.log(`Hello, ${fNames[2]}!`);
